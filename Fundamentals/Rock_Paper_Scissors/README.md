# Rock, Paper, Scissors

Welcome to my RPS project from The Odin Project! Play a quick game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer.

## It demonstrates the following:
- Effective use of CSS grid to format the shape of the calculator

## Functionality:
- All button clicks will add the correct input to the output box
- The AC button will clear the output box
- The DEL button will erase one character at a time
- The = button will evaluate the expression as seen in the output
- All standard math operations work as intended
- Use of word wrap allows the output box to take up as many lines as needed, without overflowing
- Output box updated with keypresses from the keyboard 

## Features to be added:
- A previous and current number counter
- Additional buttons, such as '(', ')'
- Media Queries for screen sizes below a width of 450px
