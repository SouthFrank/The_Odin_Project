# Rock, Paper, Scissors

Welcome to my RPS project from The Odin Project! Play a quick game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer.

## It demonstrates the following:
- DOM manipulation to update scores and to add event listeners to the buttons
- Real-time score keeping and notification of a winner when either the user or computer hit 5

## Functionality:
- Choose your choice of Rock, Paper, or Scissors
- After choosing, your choice will play a round against a randomized choice from the 'computer'

## Features to be added:
- Updated styling to the page - header, images for choice of RPS, button improvements
